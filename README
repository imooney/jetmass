This project (located in /wsu/home/fs/fs33/fs3383/jetmass on the WSU grid) is the starting point for an eventual jet mass analysis in AuAu collisions at the STAR experiment. pythia6jetmass/ is a self-contained analysis of jet mass in pp collisions at 200 GeV in both truth simulation (Pythia6 [undecayed]) and measured simulation (Pythia6+Geant). ppjetmass/ is the same but for STAR data (pp run6 200 GeV - HT trigger).
The project is run on our nodes of the WSU grid using the csh file in submit/ ('csh path/to/file.csh') (the qwrap.sh file is necessary for it to run). Running produces log & err files in the log/ directory, and an analysis output in the out/ directory. The resulting .root files should be combined with e.g.: 'hadd -f full.root pico*'.
After examining full.root, one can go to the macros/ directory to make some nice plots of the basic quantities (pT, eta, phi) by running initial_checks.C. They are saved to the plots/ directory. Once ppjetmass and pythia6jetmass have produced 'full.root' files in the out/ directory, one can run mass_plots_data_sim.C for some plots of jet mass comparing simulation and data.

To be added soon:
Currently, the project is not configured to allow command line input when running the submit script, and as a result, the output and log/err files are under the subdirectory 'stock'. Soon I will add the ability for the user to select non-default cuts and criteria.
Now that this battle station is fully operational, I'll go through soon (when I'm less lazy) and add more comments. I'll also encapsulate more lines of code as functions for better flow, legibility, and generality.

Physics note: the Pythia6+GEANT does not require a 5.4 GeV HT trigger, so the mass IS supposed to look much different in a comparison between this and the ppHT data for integrated pT. However, in smaller pT slices, as pT increases, the ratio of the mass between the two should approach unity, which is indeed what is seen via the mass plotting macro in the top-level directory.
